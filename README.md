# OpenTableTest
Hey guys, first of all I would like to thank you for the opportunity, I could not archive the project as I only have my current job computer and I have restricted access.
I had a very busy weekend but I managed to deliver all the requirements and I hope you find this solution adequate and consider to move forward with my application.

I feel more confident using UIKit as I have way more experience with it, never the less I wanted to make this test in SwiftUI because it is the future of iOS development and I think you guys use it a lot in your project.
I timeboxed myself to 4 hours and I didn't have time to make some improvements I would have wanted to do like adding data persistance and improving UI, I implemented a very basic design without animations or beatiful colors.ß
I implemented basic MVVM architecture.

If you have any questions about the implementation please don't hesitate to contact me.
